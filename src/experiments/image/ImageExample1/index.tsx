//# Next.js' Image component doesn't have a built-in way to specify a fallback
//# image directly. However, you can use the onError event to set up a fallback
//# image. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

// import { useState } from 'react';
// import Image from 'next/image';

// const CustomImage = ({ src, fallbackSrc, ...props }) => {
//   const [imgSrc, setImgSrc] = useState(src);

//   return (
//     <Image
//       {...props}
//       src={imgSrc}
//       onError={() => setImgSrc(fallbackSrc)}
//       alt={props.alt}
//     />
//   );
// };

// // Usage
// <CustomImage
//   src='/landscape.jpg'
//   fallbackSrc='/fallback.jpg'
//   width={500}
//   height={500}
//   className={`mx-auto mb-6 block h-[300px] w-[300px] rounded-lg border-2 border-black bg-[#333] object-contain shadow-[0_35px_60px_-15px_rgba(0,0,0,0.3)]`}
//   quality={75}
//   alt='Random Image'
//   priority
// />

//# The above example is from AI.
//# See Next.js for their own demo: https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/image-fallback
//# More generally, I would look at all their tamplates.

      store an object that contains the URL as well as metadata about the image.
